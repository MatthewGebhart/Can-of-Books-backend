## Paired Programming expectations (with Erik Dodd)

**Logistical**

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - Share work on new material, and help each other reinforce previous concepts
**Conflict Resolution**
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Communication, setting expectations, etc.
